# secure-save-photos

I have committed my pods and should be able to build my project straight of the box to a real iPhone. 


# further considerations

My main issue was not fully completing the assignment. I had set up the camera to snap 10 pictures and save them in the keychain. If I had more time, I would see if I could improve the amount of time it took to actually snap the pictures. 

I decided to use RNCrytor to encrypt the image data. I didn't get to implementing the proper password handling. Instead, I set up the user to enter a password so I could actually encrypt the image data. 

Other issues was not supplying a decent UI and refactoring code to be in more appropriate places.
